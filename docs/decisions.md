# Architecture decisions

## ADR-001 — Gateway-first Hermes integration

**Status:** accepted for MVP

The Go service connects to the Hermes Gateway/API Server instead of importing the Python agent runtime or spawning the Hermes CLI. This is the cleanest runtime boundary for a non-Python rewrite and matches the bridge already supported by the original WebUI.

The adapter uses `POST /v1/chat/completions` with streaming enabled. Runs API support (`POST /v1/runs`) will be added when approval parity starts.

## ADR-002 — Compatibility BFF

The browser uses the original two-step shape: start a turn, then subscribe to a stream. The BFF normalizes Gateway-specific frames to `token`, `reasoning`, `tool`, `tool_complete`, `done`, `cancel`, and `apperror` events.

## ADR-003 — Modern visual system, preserved composition

Pixel parity is no longer a release requirement. We preserve the three-region composition, session-first navigation, central conversation flow, optional workspace surface, and mobile navigation. Visuals use a modern neutral shadcn dashboard language powered by Tailwind v4 tokens.

## ADR-004 — Single binary remains the distribution target

The repository starts with independently served frontend and Go API for fast iteration. Before M3, the frontend production output must be embedded into the Go binary. This sequencing prevents embed mechanics from blocking the chat integration spike.
